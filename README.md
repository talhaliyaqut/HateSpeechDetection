# HateSpeechDetection
The project presents a comprehensive hate speech detection system that addresses the limitations
of existing solutions by leveraging advanced machine learning and natural language processing
techniques. Unlike traditional systems that are limited to static datasets and text-only inputs, this
system supports multimedia inputs, including audio, video, and URLs, making it versatile and
adaptable to real-world scenarios. The core of the system integrates OpenAIâ€™s Whisper for
converting multimedia content into text and a fine-tuned Llama-2 model specifically trained for
hate speech classification.
To ensure accessibility, the system features a user-friendly web application developed using
Streamlit, which provides seamless interaction and real-time analysis. Users can easily upload
multimedia content, receive immediate results, and gain actionable insights into the detected hate
speech. The system's unique ability to process diverse input formats and adapt to evolving
linguistic patterns makes it a powerful tool for moderating online content and enhancing digital
safety.
This project lays the foundation for future advancements in content moderation by enabling the
detection of hate speech across multiple languages and evolving forms of expression. It
highlights the importance of multimedia analysis, robust classification models, and user-centered
design in tackling the complex challenge of online hate speech
